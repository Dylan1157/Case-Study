1950s - 1960s 
With the computer industry on the rise due to the development of the first digital computer screen in 1947, the idea that computers can be used for the purpose of entertainment could become a reality. In 1958 American physicist Willam Higinbotham sets out to work on the first video game developed for entertainment called “Tenis for Two” and finishes his work in October of the same year. The game was developed for the Oscilloscope, a device that uses electricity to display frequency and form an image. The game was very simple and only featured and single vertical line to represent the net, and a ball that would fly back and forth with an input. This game was very influential on a group of programmers, so influential that it inspired the development of “Spacewars” in 1962.
