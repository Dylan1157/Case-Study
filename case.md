## Timeline
1950s - 1960s 
With the computer industry on the rise due to the development of the first digital computer screen in 1947, the idea that computers can be used for the purpose of entertainment could become a reality. In 1958 American physicist Willam Higinbotham sets out to work on the first video game developed for entertainment called “Tenis for Two” and finishes his work in October of the same year. The game was developed for the Oscilloscope, a device that uses electricity to display frequency and form an image. The game was very simple and only featured and single vertical line to represent the net, and a ball that would fly back and forth with an input. This game was very influential on a group of programmers, so influential that it inspired the development of “Spacewars” in 1962. 

1971 
The first arcade cabinet was created in 1971 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney, founders of Atari and creators of Pong. The game was called “Computer Space”. It was a very simple game set in space where you play as a little spaceship that flew around dodging projectiles and fighting UFOs. With the end of the space race, the theme of outer space was extremely popular and profitable. This led to the game having great success with the populous. Nolan had specifically asked for the arcade cabinet to be bright yellow and an odd shape to catch the eye of people walking past it and to draw them in.
